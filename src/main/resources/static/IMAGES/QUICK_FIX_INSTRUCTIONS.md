# QUICK FIX: Add Your Images Correctly

## The Problem:
Your images aren't showing because they weren't saved to the correct location or with the correct names.

## IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Step 1: Check Your Images Folder
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Student\MaxxEnergy\MaxxEnergyAPI\src\main\resources\static\IMAGES\`
3. Look for your image files

### Step 2: If Images Are Missing
1. Go back to our conversation
2. Find your team and mission photos
3. Right-click and "Save image as..."
4. Save to: `C:\Users\Student\MaxxEnergy\MaxxEnergyAPI\src\main\resources\static\IMAGES\`
5. Name them EXACTLY:
   - `mission-image.jpeg`
   - `team-image.jpeg`

### Step 3: If Images Are There But Wrong Names
1. Rename them to:
   - `mission-image.jpeg`
   - `team-image.jpeg`

### Step 4: Restart Spring Boot
1. Stop your Spring Boot application (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart it: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

## CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ About page is working
- ✅ Video is working
- ✅ Placeholder images are showing
- ❌ Your actual images need to be saved correctly

## AFTER YOU FIX THE IMAGES:
Tell me when you've saved them correctly, and I'll update the code to use your real images instead of placeholders.

**The images will work once they're saved in the right place with the right names!**
