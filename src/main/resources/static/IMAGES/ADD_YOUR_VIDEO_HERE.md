# ADD YOUR ACTUAL VIDEO HERE!

## The Problem:
You sent me a video file, but I cannot save video files from our conversation to your computer. I can only see descriptions of them.

## The Solution:
**You need to save your video file manually:**

### Step 1: Find Your Video
1. Go back through our conversation
2. Find the video file you shared with me
3. Right-click on the video
4. Select "Save video as..." or "Download"

### Step 2: Save to Correct Location
1. Save the video to: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`
2. **Rename it to**: `Understanding Basics of the Power Market.mp4`

### Step 3: I'll Update the Code
Once you save your video file, I'll update the about page to use your actual video instead of the sample video.

## Current Status:
- ✅ About page is working
- ✅ Video player is set up correctly
- ❌ Using sample video instead of your actual video
- ❌ Need you to save your video file as `Understanding Basics of the Power Market.mp4`

## After You Save Your Video:
1. Tell me you've saved it
2. I'll update the code to use your video
3. Your actual video will play on the about page!

**The video player is ready - I just need you to save your actual video file!**
