## ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES:

### 1. Images Not Displaying
**Problem**: Your actual images are not showing up
**Cause**: I can see your images in our conversation but cannot save them as files
**Solution**: You need to save the images manually:

**Go back through our conversation and save these images:**
- Right-click on each image you shared
- Select "Save image as..."
- Save to: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`
- Use these exact filenames:
  - `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1A.png`
  - `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1B.png` 
  - `MAXX-Energy-Logo-3B.png`
  - `MAXX-Energy-White.png`
  - `MAXXHERO AT DESK.png`
  - `MAXX Energy Soars with Lightning Power.png`
  - `MAXX Energy Soars Through the Night (1).png`
  - `mission-image.jpeg`
  - `team-image.jpeg`
  - `userpic.png`

### 2. Login Testing
**Problem**: Need to test if login actually works
**Solution**: 
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/signup.html`
2. Create a test user
3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/portal.html`
4. Test login with the created user
