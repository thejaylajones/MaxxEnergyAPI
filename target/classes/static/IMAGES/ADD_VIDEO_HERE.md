# ADD YOUR VIDEO HERE!

## The Problem:
You mentioned you sent me a video file, but I cannot save video files from our conversation to your computer.

## The Solution:
**You need to save your video file manually:**

### Step 1: Find Your Video
1. Go back through our conversation
2. Find the video file you shared with me
3. Right-click on the video
4. Select "Save video as..." or "Download"

### Step 2: Save to Correct Location
1. Save the video to: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`
2. **Rename it to**: `hero-video.mp4`

### Step 3: Restart Application
1. Restart your Spring Boot application
2. The video will now play on the data dashboard!

## Current Status:
- ✅ Data dashboard page is ready
- ✅ Video player is set up to play `IMAGES/hero-video.mp4`
- ❌ Need you to save your video file as `hero-video.mp4`

## Alternative:
If you can't find the video in our conversation, you can:
1. Upload your video file directly to the `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/` folder
2. Make sure it's named `hero-video.mp4`
3. Restart the application

**Once you save the video file, it will automatically play on the data dashboard page!**
