# MAXX Energy Frontend Images

## How to Add Your Images

You need to save the images you shared with me to this folder. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Save Each Image
1. Right-click on each image you shared with me
2. Select "Save image as..."
3. Save them to this folder: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`

### Step 2: Required Images
Save these images with these exact names:

**Logo Files:**
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1A.png` (main logo - used in multiple pages)
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1B.png` (homepage hero logo)
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-3B.png` (FAQ page logo)
- `MAXX-Energy-White.png` (FAQ page white logo)

**Hero Images:**
- `MAXXHERO AT DESK.png` (portal & data dashboard)
- `MAXX Energy Soars with Lightning Power.png` (FAQ hero)
- `MAXX Energy Soars Through the Night (1).png` (about page video overlay)

**Content Images:**
- `mission-image.jpeg` (about page mission section)
- `team-image.jpeg` (about page team section)
- `userpic.png` (user profile default avatar)

### Step 3: After Saving Images
Once you've saved all the images:
1. Restart your Spring Boot application
2. Your website will display with all the actual images instead of placeholders

### Current Status
- ✅ Placeholder images are working
- ❌ Need to save your actual images to replace placeholders
- ✅ Videos are working (SharePoint & Google Drive links)
- ✅ All styling and functionality is working

## Quick Fix
For now, the website works with placeholder images. To get your actual images:
1. Save each image you shared with me
2. Put them in this IMAGES folder
3. Restart the application
