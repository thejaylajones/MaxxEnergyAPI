# ADD YOUR ACTUAL TEAM AND MISSION PHOTOS HERE!

## The Problem:
You sent me team and mission photos, but I cannot save image files from our conversation to your computer. I can only see descriptions of them.

## The Solution:
**You need to save your image files manually:**

### Step 1: Find Your Photos
1. Go back through our conversation
2. Find the team photo you shared with me
3. Find the mission photo you shared with me
4. Right-click on each image
5. Select "Save image as..." or "Download"

### Step 2: Save to Correct Location
1. Save the **mission photo** to: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`
2. **Rename it to**: `mission-image.jpeg`
3. Save the **team photo** to: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`
4. **Rename it to**: `team-image.jpeg`

### Step 3: I'll Update the Code
Once you save your image files, I'll update the about page to use your actual photos instead of the placeholder images.

## Current Status:
- ✅ About page is working
- ✅ Video is working with your actual video
- ❌ Using placeholder images instead of your actual photos
- ❌ Need you to save your photos as `mission-image.jpeg` and `team-image.jpeg`

## After You Save Your Photos:
1. Tell me you've saved them
2. I'll update the code to use your actual photos
3. Your real team and mission photos will display on the about page!

**The about page is ready - I just need you to save your actual photo files!**
