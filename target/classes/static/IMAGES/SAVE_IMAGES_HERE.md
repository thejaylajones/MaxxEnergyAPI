# URGENT: Save Your Images Here!

## The Problem:
- You've sent me all your images multiple times
- I can see them but cannot save them as files
- Your website needs these actual image files to work properly

## The Solution:
**You need to save each image from our conversation:**

### Step 1: Go Back Through Our Conversation
1. Scroll up through our chat
2. Find each image you shared with me
3. Right-click on each image
4. Select "Save image as..."
5. Save them to this folder: `src/main/resources/static/IMAGES/`

### Step 2: Save These Images with These Exact Names:

**From the images you just sent me:**
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1A.png` (the main logo with golden symbol and blue text)
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-1B.png` (another version of the logo) 
- `MAXX-Energy-Logo-3B.png` (FAQ page logo)
- `MAXX-Energy-White.png` (white version of logo)
- `MAXXHERO AT DESK.png` (superhero at computer)
- `MAXX Energy Soars with Lightning Power.png` (superhero with lightning)
- `MAXX Energy Soars Through the Night (1).png` (night superhero)
- `mission-image.jpeg` (control room worker)
- `team-image.jpeg` (electrical substation workers)
- `userpic.png` (generic user profile icon)

### Step 3: After Saving All Images
1. Restart your Spring Boot application
2. Your website will display with your actual images!

## Why This Happened:
- I can see your images (as descriptions)
- But I cannot save them as files to your computer
- Only you can save them from our conversation

## Current Status:
- ✅ Website works with placeholder images
- ✅ All functionality works (videos, styling, navigation)
- ❌ Need you to save your actual images to replace placeholders

**Once you save your images, your website will look exactly as your team designed it!**
